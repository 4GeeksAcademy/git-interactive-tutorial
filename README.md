    <h2 align="center"> Git Interactive Tutorial (beta) </h2>
</p>

Learning git can be hard without the right tutorial, hopefully this guided tour will point you in the right direction. :bowtie:

Just [click here](https://4GeeksAcademy.github.io/git-interactive-tutorial) to start learning!

Note: a very similar tutorial was published on try.github.com but it was deleted for some reason, that is why at 4Geeks Academy we decided to replicate it and open source it to the community!

### Give it a start if you like it!
